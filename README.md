# project overview

Humans are social beingsâ€”we thrive on connection, even if only occasionally. People can bond over  anything, even the most unconventional experiences. My project was originally inspired by a song, "Happy Together" by The Turtles (1967), but it kept reminding me of a movie, Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961). The movie tells the story of two "gold diggers" who bonded over their unattainable dreams, portraying how shared aspirations create lasting connections.
